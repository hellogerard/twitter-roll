Twitter Roll
============


A small PHP script that displays the members of a public Twitter list with their
picture, bio, and last tweet.

Inspired by <http://theskiff.org/crew/>.

This code includes the TwitterOAuth library (version 0.1)
<<http://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth>> for PHP written by Abraham Williams.

1. Create a Twitter app at <http://twitter.com/apps>. Record the app consumer
   tokens.
2. Authorize the app for your (or someone's) Twitter account. Record the
   resulting OAuth tokens.
3. Create a Twitter list.
4. Configure the script with your data.
