Twitter Roll
============


A small PHP script that displays the members of a public Twitter list with their
picture, bio, and last tweet.

Inspired by <http://theskiff.org/crew/>.

This code includes the TwitterOAuth library (version 0.1)
<<http://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth>> for PHP written by Abraham Williams.


Setup
=====

1. Create a Twitter app at <http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new>.
2. Record the app `consumer tokens` on the application detail page.
3. Record your `OAuth tokens` on the application detail page. (Or you can get someone to authorize the app and record theirs.)
4. Create a Twitter list.
5. Configure the script with the four tokens and the Twitter list name.
